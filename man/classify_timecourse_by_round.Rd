\title{Classify genes by multi-round monotonic time-course patterns}
\usage{
classify_timecourse_by_round(
  mat,
  rho_cut = 0.75,
  min_len = 4,
  trim_side = c("best", "head", "tail")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{A numeric matrix with genes in rows and time-ordered samples
in columns. Row names must correspond to gene identifiers.}

\item{rho_cut}{Numeric scalar specifying the absolute Spearman correlation
threshold for calling a monotonic trend. Default is 0.75.}

\item{min_len}{Integer specifying the minimum number of samples required
to perform trend classification. Default is 4.}

\item{trim_side}{Character string specifying how to trim the time window
at each iteration. One of:}
}
\value{
A data.frame with one row per gene and the following columns:gene,gene_group,type
}
\description{
This function classifies genes based on monotonic temporal trends
using an iterative Spearman correlation strategy across progressively
trimmed time windows. At each round, genes exhibiting significant
positive or negative monotonicity are assigned to Up or
Down groups corresponding to the round at which the trend
first becomes detectable.
}
\details{
The time window is shortened by removing one boundary sample
(head, tail, or automatically selected) after each round, until
fewer than min_len samples remain.
