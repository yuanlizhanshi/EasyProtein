\title{Save plots in multiple formats with standardized resolution}
\usage{
saveplot(object, filenames = filename, width = NULL, height = NULL, dpi = 600)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A plot object to be saved. Can be a \code{ggplot} object or a
grid graphical object such as \code{gList}.}

\item{filenames}{A character string specifying the base filename (without
file extension) for the output figures.}

\item{width}{Numeric. Figure width in inches. Must be provided.}

\item{height}{Numeric. Figure height in inches. Must be provided.}

\item{dpi}{Numeric. Resolution in dots per inch. Default is \code{600}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. The function is called for its side effect
  of writing figure files to disk.
}
\description{
Save a plot object into PDF, TIFF, and PNG formats simultaneously with
predefined scaling rules for width, height, and resolution. Output files
are automatically organized into subdirectories under a \code{Fig/} folder.
}
\details{
This function is designed for publication-quality figure export, supporting
both ggplot objects and grid graphical objects (e.g., \code{gList}).


The function creates a directory structure:
\describe{
  \item{Fig/PDF}{PDF output}
  \item{Fig/TIFF}{TIFF output}
  \item{Fig/PNG}{PNG output}
}

File dimensions are scaled internally:
\itemize{
  \item PDF: width and height multiplied by 2.
  \item TIFF: width and height multiplied by 1000.
  \item PNG: width and height multiplied by 500.
}

For PNG output, if \code{dpi > 600}, the resolution is automatically set to 300;
otherwise, \code{dpi/2} is used.

If \code{object} is of class \code{gList}, the plot is rendered using
\code{grid.draw()}; otherwise, \code{print()} is used.

\dontrun{
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point()

saveplot(
  object = p,
  filenames = "mtcars_scatter",
  width = 6,
  height = 4,
  dpi = 600
)
}
